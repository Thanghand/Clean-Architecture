# **Database is a detail**

The data model is highly significant to your architecture and most likely is part of your entities. However, the database tool to access your data is a low level detail that is not an architectural element.

-   Your use cases should not know or care about the way data is stored.
-   Knowledge of the tabular structure should be restricted to the data access (aka gateways) layer of the clean architecture.
-   Many frameworks allow database rows and tables to be passed around the system. This is an architectural error that couples use cases, business rules and even the UI to the structure of the data.
-   Your use cases should depend on your data model, which most likely is a set of rich objects or data structures like linked lists, trees, hash tables, queues, etc. We almost always map the tabular data into other data structures and very rarely work with rows and tables directly on our use cases or business rules.

## **What about performance**?

-   Performance is architecturally significant, but it can be entirely encapsulated and separated from the business rules.

-   Getting data in an out of the data store quickly should be handled outside of the business rules in the lower level data access mechanisms.

# **Web is a detail**

-   It has a long history of pendulum swings from centralizing computing
    power (e.g. server rendered pages), to distributing it (e.g. front end
    apps) and back. **As architects, we want to shield our business form
    those swings and be able to adapt to the swings.**

-   The philosophical bottom line is **the GUI is a detail and the web is a
    GUI.** The web is nothing more than an IO device and hence we should try
    to isolate it from our business logic.

-   The practical bottom line is that with ultra-rich web UIs that
    constantly communicate with the servers, aiming for full device
    independence in all interactions might be unpractical.

-   A more practical approach is to reason about the interactions between
    the GUI and the application as if they were divided into two types:

-   Small and constant interactions that happen to build up and **complete
    the set of inputs** required to run a use case (e.g. drag and drops to
    sort things, async loading of drop down data, autocompletes)
-   Business critical interactions that happen when the **complete input
    data is sent to a use case**, the use cases processes the data and
    returns an output to the GUI.

-   Trying to achieve device independence for the first type of interactions
    is probably unpractical and not business critical. On the other hand, it
    is easier to do so for the second type and luckily our precious business
    logic (use cases) can be separated from the GUI in this case.

# **Frameworks are details**

-   Frameworks are powerful and useful; but they are not architectures.

-   Use frameworks but try not to marry them. If you marry into a framework,make sure that it is a conscious decision and that the team understands that it will be part of you application forever (until you re-write it).

## **An asymmetric marriage**

You relationships with frameworks is asymmetric in nature: as engineers
we make an enormous commitment to them by coupling our business logic to
the framework. But, the framework maintainers don't know us and probably
won't steer the framework to solve our problems if problems happen.

### **The risks of marrying into a framework**

-   Frameworks architecture is often not very clean and tend to violate
    the dependency rule. Your project should follow the structure that
    your code needs, not the one the framework needs.
-   Frameworks often require you to tightly couple your business logic
    code to them by subclassing or mixing in framework classes or modules
    into your `Entities` and `Use Cases`. Once you do that, the framework
    is not coming back out of your app.
-   The framework might help you with early development of features. But
    once your product matures and outgrows the framework, you will start
    fighting it.
-   The framework might evolve into a direction that you don't find
    useful, it might get abandoned or you might want to switch. Once you
    couple to it, you are stuck upgrading to new versions even if you
    don't need them.

## **Use frameworks but do not marry them**

-   Treat frameworks as details and limit its use to the outer layers of the
    [clean architecture.](part-5-2-architecture.md#chapter-22---the-clean-architecture)
    That is, don't let them into your `Use Cases` or `Entities`.

-   If you _need_ to let them in, don't derive a framework class, derive a
    proxy instead that you control and that acts as a _plugin_ to the
    business rules.

## **Unavoidable marriages**

There are things you will need to marry. Just make sure it is _decision_
and you understand the extend of the commitment. For example, you will
need to mary the standard library for any programming language you use.

# **Case Study**

There is also a case study and a chapter by Simon Brown which compare different code organisation : package by layer, feature or component. Ideas can be found here:
